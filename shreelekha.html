                    <h3>Some ceaseless thoughts</h3>
                    <p>  
                        Sheelekhaaaaaa...<br>
                        I don't know where to start, how to start... foremost thing I don't know why I want share thoughts with you.
                        It has been going on for a long time, Shreelekhaaa, recently I am returning to the same thoughts again and again...
                        sometimes I feel pathetic for myself... being so needy, always searching for something which I don't know what it is...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sheelekaaaa ninnu adagadaniki boledanni unnayi sheelekaaaaa. kani adagalo ledo telidu. adagocho ledo telidu. 
                        What am I to you Sheelekaaaa? if we are friends, then why do I have to think if I can share something with you. Why can't I 
                        say something just like I say to Rahul? Poni, just classmates aa ante adi kuda kadu sheelekaaaaa. I know I am being bound by past,
                        but I can't help it. Because I had been happy when I am around you. More than being happy, I am so comfortable with you.
                        Just like I have to be with my sister or someone I know from my childhood. 
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        One of the main insecurity I am feeling is losing you Sheelekaaaa. Everytime I think of you or me getting married, 
                        I feel it is the end for us. I can see that. I just can't call you and ask if you are doing good or not. You are one
                        of the Precious people in my life, whom I can't afford losing. But now I feel like we are going to end. Ofcourse someday
                        it will happen, but that happening soon is somewhat hard to digest. You know what I learnt from you, laughing my heart out.
                        I haven't seen someone smiling and laughing after grown up as pure as you. I miss that everytime Sheelekaaa. You never wain 
                        about your difficulties, you stay strong and independent. In this world of princesses, you had already been a Queen..
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I know that I am being unreasonable. I know I am being selfish. I can't ask you to be with me always, but I want that to happen.
                        I have made it too complicated Sheelekaaaa. I can't like you if you don't like me to like you. I think I have said this, 
                        Everything that is happening now is as I planned long ago, I am regretting that why didn't I plan something different. Why did I chose those
                        decisions? I know this turned out to be successful in some perspective, but at cost of losing loved ones. I definitely can't call it a complete success.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Have you heard the song "Phir bhi tumko chahunga", it is one of my favourite songs. All it says is 
                        "our paths might get seperated, we might get lost in our way, but I still want you. I don't know tomorrow we stay the same, I don't know tomorrow I have permission, but I still want 
                        to be with you. I need you like I need my breath. Even my heart breaks into pieces, I still hold them and wait for you.". I feel telling the same 
                        with you, but not sure if I can say or not. There are many things which i want to say, but you should hear those from your loved ones.
                        I don't want to give you spoilers by snatching your firsts. Again it comes to square one, I can't like you if you don't like
                         me to like you, because I like you so much Sheelekaaa, more than liking you, I admire you soo much.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If I say a reason to like you, then I am definitely making up something, because I liked you innately and later searched 
                        reasons to say why I like you. But none of the reason backed me up. I failed to make you feel assured with me, I failed to gain your trust.
                        I know you already had a lot on your plate. I didn't want to add more to it. I didn't want to be someone who would pester you
                        and get hatred by you. But in the end I am being the same guy, hope you forgive me, hmm, I am even asking you this, despite knowing that I am
                        being unreasonable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I kept smiling Everytime you were in my dreams, I slept smiling for feeling your warmth even when I hugged you in my dreams. 
                        I stood smiling at my failure for letting you pass away from me. I had been a passing cloud over your beautiful world, but I am selfish
                        and thought of staying there forever, but that is not the rule, clouds should pass away and leave the world sometime. Even now I can't assure 
                        that I will stay there if you allow me to stay. Things are out of our hands now, but I want to stay Sheelekaaaaa.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sometimes I laugh at myself for thinking that we could talk even in silence, but now we are becoming strangers where 
                        even words can't be communicated. Thoughts had been like we would be soaring over skies together, but turning out to be strangers
                        with memories is not that simple to move on... I don't want to move on Sheelekaaaa, I had been so happy in our past, I can't let it go,
                        but that is the right way I guess. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Sheelekaaaaa, I need a help. If you ever feel we have to end, can you tell me the reason why we are not together?
                        I know what you will say If I ask you," What should I have done to get you?".. so tell me what I should have done to NOT lose you???
                        Whatever you say, I will believe it, no matter what you say. But tell me something sheelekaaaaa whenever you feel like saying.
                        Hope you will not share them soon.
                    </p>
